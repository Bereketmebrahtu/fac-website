<div class="about-me-title">Who Am I? My Journey </div>

<div class="about-me-content">
<p id="about-me">My name is Bereket Mebrahtu, I was born and raised in a beautiful east African country known as Eritrea.
I moved to the UK in August 2004 at the age of 16 and have been living in London ever since.
I studied Pharmaceutical Science at Kingston Univerity and graduated with a Bsc degree. 
I graduated in 2012 but my degree didnt lead to a promising career in the Pharmaceutical sector, 
Instead I ended up in the retail sector. I love watching sitcom in my spare time and The Big Bag theory is my favourite show todate.
I enjoy following events that have impact on life as we know it and poslitics and current geopolitics are amongst the things I enjoy.

        Why Fac you may ask, because software development in general and coding in particular has been a passion of mine for sometime.
        However, prior to my unexpected discovery of the FAC website, I was convinced the only way to become a software developer was throught
        traditional acadamic paths such as a Univerity degree. Having studied Pharmaceutical scince at University, I found myself lost and unsure of 
        what direction I wanted to take as far as my career was concerned. I embarked on a journey of self discovery and decided to rekindle my love for what I have always been interested in and that
        was software development. I have alway been curios about what goes on under the hood of websites, apps,data systems therefore I decided the time has come for me 
        to persue a career in the Tech industry. Currently working as a retail manager at William hill bookmakers with no passion left in me to continue 
        to work in an industry that has very little to offer in terms of opportunities for growth.
