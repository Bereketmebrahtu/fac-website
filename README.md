welcome to my Fac Application webiste

Structured as a single page my website incorporated my knowledge showcasing the skills i have acquired during my time since Joining the FAC family. besides the basic HTML, CSS and Javascript set up, I have also included a brief introduction to who i am as a person so that a user gets to know me. 

I utilised CSS cards to allowe for better design and styling afterwards, grouped my sections in divs with classes so that when it comes to styling they weould come handy tools. I included an ambitious CSS animation sttributes and properties for better user appeal.

My site inclused features Image carousel as well as some CSS styling and properties such as Hover anD focus.

Sime of the resources used in designing the website are as follows:
